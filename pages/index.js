            I enjoy designing and implementing full-stack features with complex
            functionalities at Pingboard. I&apos;ve helped migrate legacy
            front-end code to modern technologies. I&apos;m passionate about
            improving user experience and understand technologies on a deeper
            level.

            I graduated with an Advertising major with Element of Computing
            Certificate and a Business Minor at the University of Texas at
            Austin. I earned the Element of Computing Certificate by taking 30
            hours of Computer Science classes. I mastered software engineering
            principles and worked with peers to design and built full-stack web
            apps, iOS apps, games, and computer graphics.

          I spent the first 18 years of my life in Fuzhou, China. I missed all
          my close friends and tasty foodies there. I moved to Austin, TX for my
          undergrad. I went to the University of Texas at Austin for 4 years.
          Since graduation, I've been working at Pingboard as a Software
          Engineer.
